# Leveraging pubmed to create a specialty-based sense inventory for spanish acronym resolution


Acronyms frequently occur in clinical text, which makes their identification, disambiguation and resolution an important task in clinical natural language processing. This paper contributes to acronym resolution in Spanish through the creation of a set of sense inventories organized by clinical specialty containing acronyms, their expansions, and corpus-driven features. The new acronym resource is composed of 51 clinical specialties with 3,603 acronyms in total, from which we identified 228 language independent acronyms and 391 language dependent expansions. We further analyzed the sense inventory across specialties and present novel insights of acronym usage in biomedical Spanish texts.
