# Leveraging PubMed to create a specialty-based sense inventory for acronym resolution in Spanish
Text normalization in clinical natural language processing includes the task to identify acronyms  to obtain their appropriate expanded form.
This paper contributes to acronym resolution in Spanish through the creation of a data resource that facilitates acronym resolution.
It is based on a set of acronym dictionaries classified by clinical specialty, where each acronyms is characterized by its expansion and a set of features.
The new acronym resource is composed of 51 clinical specialties with 3,603 acronyms. Including 228 language independent acronyms and 391 language dependent expansions.
We further analyzed the sense inventory across specialties and present novel insights of acronym usage in biomedical Spanish texts.
