# Improving-Contextual-Knowledge-forAcronym-Expansion-in-MedicalNarratives
Text normalization in clinical natural language processing involves theidentification and resolution of acronyms contained in the documents to obtain theirstandard definitions. Previous approaches to solve this problem varied dependingon whether the expansion was explicitly in the document or not. In both cases, theproblem of ambiguity arises when an identified acronym has different expansions(e.g. RA for Right Atrial or Rheumatoid Arthritis). The ambiguity issue can be addressed by analyzing the different contexts in which the acronym may exist; however, the absence of an acronym sense inventory linked with possible contexts inwhich particular expansion can be used hinders these solutions.
